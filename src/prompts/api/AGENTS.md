# App instructions

This Statespace application exposes content and commands over HTTP.

## Quick start

1. **`GET /README.md`** — discover what this application does, root-level commands, and where to navigate.
2. **Follow links** — `GET /{path}` to read any file (Markdown, data files, etc.).
3. **Execute a command** — `POST /{path}` with `{"command": [...]}` where the command is declared in that page's frontmatter.

## Command Rules

Commands are declared in YAML frontmatter of Markdown pages.
To execute a command, POST to the page path with the command array.
For example, if `page.md` declares `[grep]`, POST `{"command": ["grep", ...]}` to `/page.md`.

**Extra arguments are allowed by default**

```
Tool:       [ls]
CORRECT:    POST {"command": ["ls", "."]}
CORRECT:    POST {"command": ["ls", "--help"]}
```

**`{ }` accepts exactly one argument**

```
Tool:       [ls, { }]
CORRECT:    POST {"command": ["ls", "src"]}
CORRECT:    POST {"command": ["ls", "src", "lib"]}
INCORRECT:  POST {"command": ["ls"]}
```

**`{ regex: "pattern" }` accepts one argument matching the pattern**

```
Tool:       [cat, { regex: ".*\\.txt$" }]
CORRECT:    POST {"command": ["cat", "notes.txt"]}
CORRECT:    POST {"command": ["cat", "notes.txt", "logs.csv"]}
INCORRECT:  POST {"command": ["cat", "notes.csv"]}
```

**Fixed elements are immutable**

```
Tool:       [grep, -r, -i, { }, ./data]
CORRECT:    POST {"command": ["grep", "-r", "-i", "error", "./data"]}
CORRECT:    POST {"command": ["grep", "-r", "-i", "error", "./data", "-l"]}
INCORRECT:  POST {"command": ["grep", "-r", "error", "./data"]}
```

**Trailing `;` locks the argument list**

```
Tool:       [rm, { }, ;]
CORRECT:    POST {"command": ["rm", "file.txt"]}
INCORRECT:  POST {"command": ["rm", "-f", "file.txt"]}
```

**Never substitute the value of `$VAR`**

```
Tool:       ["psql, "$DB"]
CORRECT:    POST {"command": ["psql", "$DB", "-c", "SELECT 1"]}
INCORRECT:  POST {"command": ["psql", "postgres://localhost/mydb", "-c", "SELECT 1"]}
```
